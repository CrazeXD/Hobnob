Hobnob Project Log

Date: 12/21/22

Functionalities Completed Today (well technically up to this point since it's the first log)
- Landing Page
- User Model (still needs pfp and other features can be added later)
- User signup, login, edit, and logout (figure out password and delete account stuff later)
- Created Queue Model (untested)
- Created queue functionality (untested, needs features to filter out users based on their attributes)

Last Thing I Did: Created queue functionality (untested)

What I Need To Do Tommorow: Start looking into ways of creating the chatroom and figure out how to remove from queue on tab close
