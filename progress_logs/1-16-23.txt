Last Thing I Did: 
- Wrote function to find school address (untested but I'm scared to test it)
What I Need To Do Tommorow: 
- Put it in the view, give the user option to select which school through a redirect to another form after signup
- From the users ip address, check if they are within the range of the school, most likely 10 miles
- If so, add the school to the users profile
